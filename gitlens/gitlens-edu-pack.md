## Enabling Pro for Students

Once GitHub has approved your pack, you must sign into your GitKraken account through GitHub <strong>1 more time</strong> to enable Pro.

To sign in again, launch Visual Studio code, open the command pallet (`command/ctrl + shift + P`), and type `GitLens: Sign In to Gitkraken...`.
