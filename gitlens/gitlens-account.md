</div>

If you already have an **Organization** or **Trial Organization**, you can click on the existing organization instead and navigate to `Subscription` to change the license or add users.

## Single Sign On

Single Sign on offers a secure and easy way to sign into your account. To configure Single Sign On for your organization, refer to the Single Sign On guide <a href='https://help.gitkraken.com/gitkraken-client/single-sign-on/' target='_blank'>here</a>.

### Requirements and Configuration

Your GitKraken account may initiate an Oauth authentication flow with the following supported Identity Providers (IdPs):

- Azure Active Directory
- Okta
- Google Identity Platform
- Ping Identity

Please note that your IdP will first need to be configured before setting up the connection in your GitKraken account. For assistance, please contact your IdP administrator or consult the IdP documentation for help.

Additional requirements:
- Configurable only by GitKraken Owner or Admin
- Subscribed to either the <a href='https://www.gitkraken.com/gitlens/pricing' target='_blank'>Teams or Enterprise plan</a>

### Signing in with Single Sign On

GitLens Teams or Enterprise users will see the option to Sign in with SSO from the login screen.

<img src="/wp-content/uploads/single-sign-on.png" class="img-bordered img-responsive center">

After clicking ‚ÄúSign in with SSO‚Äù, the SSO form will open and ask for an email address to use for SSO login. The app will then check the email and determine whether the email address belongs to a single IdP for SSO. When the email address is successfully identified, the user will be taken to that IdP to login.

## Roles

There are four roles for a GitKraken user within an organization's account:

* **Owner**: Add or edit users plus access to billing. No one but the owner can transfer ownership
