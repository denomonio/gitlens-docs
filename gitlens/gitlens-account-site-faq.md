### Can I transfer account ownership?

Yes. If you are the `Owner`, then you may transfer ownership to a different user from your account.

### Do I need a license to manage users?

A licensed <kbd>Owner</kbd> or <kbd>Admin</kbd> may manage other <kbd>Admin</kbd> or general users. However, the unlicensed <kbd>Billing Contact</kbd> role may view the users list and add or remove general users.

The <kbd>User</kbd> role does not have permission to allocate, edit or remove users. 

***

### When are invoices sent when I purchase a paid license?

Invoice copies are emailed to the owner or billing contact from `accounting@gitkraken.com` immediately upon purchase. 

***
### I'm just a single-user using GitLens. What do I put for the Organization/Company field?

Enter a value of your choice. Most use "Personal" or "Self." 

***
### I just purchased a license. Where is my key? Shouldn't I get emailed a license?

Your license is tied to your email and all GitKraken licenses are managed from [https://app.gitkraken.com](https://app.gitkraken.com/). Additionally, any users you add to your account will be emailed a link to activate their account automatically.

***
### Can I use my paid GitKraken license on more than one computer?

Yes, your paid GitKraken subscription is associated with your email address, not a specific computer. So you can use GitLens Pro on as many computers as you'd like!

***
### What if I am a reseller?

Resellers may purchase licenses on behalf of an end-user. Please check out our [Reseller Guide](/gitlens/gitlens-reseller/#new-organization-purchases) for specific reseller purchasing instructions.

***

### I will pay using a credit card, but I need the credit card details removed after purchase.

Please email <accounting@gitkraken.com> with any request to manually remove billing details from an account. We typically fulfill these requests within 1 business day.
